## Why that name?
![Image of map of the map](/.assets/images/map-of-the-name.jpg)

We came up with this name because we first tried to visualize for whom and why our application is intended. We came up with something like this (the name is in Ukrainian): the grey area represents the whole world, the black elements are people we don't know yet, the yellow area represents the "acquaintance" zone of people we know or knew and remember a little bit, the green area represents friends or "best friends". The black elements can change color depending on the zone they are in, it can be:

1. Unknown person
2. Potential acquaintance
3. Acquaintance
4. Potential friend
5. Friend

The recommended combined elements refer to the fact that as a person who has such a map, you can consider them more as friends than as separate entities for each of them.

Every person has such a map.

As you can see, the map is similar to a city or village map, or even to a tribe, and one can even see it as a single tribe. We haven't included categories like "cheater" or "thief" because we want to avoid such cases, so only "good people" are left, and in the context of a single tribe, it becomes a friendly tribe, which in English is "Friendly Tribe" and can be combined to make "Tribly".
